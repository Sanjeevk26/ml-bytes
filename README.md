# ML Bytes

**ML Bytes** is a collection of **bite-sized, story-driven explanations of core machine learning concepts**, backed by **runnable Python scripts**.  
The goal is simple: **build intuition**, not just formulas.

This repository is designed for:
- Beginners learning ML fundamentals
- Professionals preparing for interviews
- Practitioners who want clear mental models for real-world ML decisions

---

## What This Repo Focuses On

- Explaining **what ML concepts actually mean in practice**
- Using **real-world stories and analogies** (not abstract math)
- Demonstrating **trade-offs and pitfalls**
- Keeping everything **small, readable, and executable**

Each script is intentionally short and self-contained.

## Current Content

### Classification Metrics  
**Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score**

Using an **Airport Security Scanner** story, this module explains:
- Confusion Matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)
- Why accuracy can be misleading on imbalanced data
- Precision vs Recall trade-offs
- How thresholds affect model behavior
- When and why F1 score matters

---

### Overfitting vs Underfitting  
**Training vs Real-World Performance**

Using an **exam preparation** analogy, this module explains:
- What underfitting and overfitting really mean
- Why high training accuracy can be misleading
- The importance of testing on unseen data
- How model complexity affects generalization

The script uses a **real dataset** and a **real machine learning model**, while keeping the explanation intuitive and beginner-friendly.

## Philosophy

ML Bytes focuses on understanding behavior, not memorizing formulas.

If you can explain a concept clearly to someone else after running a script, the ML Byte has done its job.

---

## Roadmap (Planned)

- Learning curves
- ROC vs Precision–Recall
- Data leakage
- Bias and variance
- Fairness and subgroup performance
