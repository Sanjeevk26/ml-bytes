# ML Bytes 

**ML Bytes** is a collection of **bite-sized, story-driven explanations of core machine learning concepts**, backed by **runnable Python scripts**.  
The goal is simple: **build intuition**, not just formulas.

This repository is designed for:
- Beginners learning ML fundamentals
- Professionals preparing for interviews
- Practitioners who want *clear mental models* for real-world ML decisions

---

## What This Repo Focuses On

- Explaining **what ML metrics actually mean in practice**
- Using **real-world stories and analogies** (not abstract math)
- Demonstrating **trade-offs and pitfalls** (e.g., accuracy traps)
- Keeping everything **small, readable, and executable**

Each script is intentionally short and self-contained.

### Classification Metrics  
**Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score**

Using an **Airport Security Scanner** story, this module explains:
- Confusion Matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)
- Why accuracy can be misleading on imbalanced data
- Precision vs Recall trade-offs
- How thresholds affect model behavior
- When and why F1 score matters
